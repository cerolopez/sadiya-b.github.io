  <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
  <h5>
    To provide a tangible showcase of my work, I’ve included my most recent projects part of my graduate coursework, and projects I have worked on during my previous job. Take a moment to explore below, and reach out if you’re interested in learning more about any project.

    <div class="project-title">01 ERROR CHECKER</div>
    <div class="project-stack">Java, Spring boot, thymeleaf, MySQL </div>
    <p>
      A website to help the project managers in finding errors in client-given files. This application automates the process of finding errors and points out the cell in the excel workbook that has incorrect data. First, the formatting errors such as char limit, text format example, date, email, etc. are checked, and secondly, data of the required fields are looked up in the database.

    <div class="project-title">02 Healthcare Chatbot</div>
    <div class="project-stack">Python, RASA, Twilio, SQLite </div>
    <p>
      This project was created as a part of natural language processing coursework. A Healthcare Chatbot was designed using RASA which performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) on fields such as user symptoms, and locations and provides accurate medical information based on a given query with a confidence value of 90-95%.

    <div class="project-title">03 NEXUS</div>
    <div class="project-stack">C#, MVC, SQL, HTML5, CSS, .NET framework </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimized logic for collection of sales and use tax state wise and reduced tax document creation time from 2 weeks to 1 day. </li>
      <li>Combined a legacy application with Nexus which decreased customer backlog from 30 to 0. Team revenue was doubled.</li>
      <li>The application used MVC architecture. ]C# was the main programming language and SQL for database. UI was developed using HTML5, jQuery and bootstrap.</li>S

    <div class="project-title">04 Online Requirement Questionnaire</div>
    <div class="project-stack">C#, MVC, SQL, HTML5, CSS, .NET framework </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Redesigned legacy applications and consolidated similar applications to avoid redundant questions and make it dynamic to add more sections to the questionnaire. </li>
      <li>Lead the design and implementation of automating tax forms filing process using iTextSharp, based on the answers in the questionnaire. Additionally, incorporated </li>
      <li>additional 250 tax forms without affecting the performance of the application.</li>
      <li>Added a workflow to add an excel based application into the website to eliminate dependencies and data duplication.</li>
      <li>Version control was handled with Git.</li>
      <li>Optimized application simplified the standard process, thereby increasing customer retention.</li>

    <div class="project-title">05 Production Dashboards</div>
    <div class="project-stack">Power BI, SQL, MQuery </div>
    <ul>
      <li> Designed and established statistical dashboards of tax filing automation as an IC. </li>
      <li>Power-bi dashboard constructed helped the team visualize the production database by eliminating manually running scripts on the production database.</li>

    <div class="project-title">06 Web Scrapers for Indirect Taxes</div>
    <div class="project-stack">C#, .NET Framework, REST APIs, SQL, Selenium, JavaScript</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented tax filing automation for several states leveraging selenium for web scraping. </li>
      <li>Built APIs for end-user, to access data without causing any security vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Enhanced UI for client-side web applications utilizing MVC.</li>

    <div class="project-title">07 Breast Cancer prediction using ML algorithms</div>
    <div class="project-stack">Python, ML</div>
    <p>
      Devised a breast cancer prediction system leveraging 3 different ML algorithms (Kth Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-layer perceptron neural networks) to find the fastest and most accurate approach using data repository from Kaggle.

    <div class="project-title">08 Energy Efficient C-means algorithm</div>
    <div class="project-stack">Cuda</div>
    <p>
      Used Cuda and 3 alternatives to calculate the distance between the center of the cluster and the data point to help determine which distance formula works in multi-dimensional space and how much energy is consumed. With an increase in the size of data and an increased demand for clustering algorithms for various applications, energy consumption was an important factor: reduction in energy consumption was therefore one of the main aims of this research.
