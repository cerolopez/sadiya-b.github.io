            Resigned from my software engineering postion at Avalara Technologies to pursue higher studies. I am a Computer Science major and have completed 3 semesters and currently in my last semester. I expect to graduate this December 2022. I have been working as a TA for 3 semesters for the course Algorithms and now a TA for software engineering course. Foundations of AI and Web development are the courses I chose for my last semester at Northeastern university.

          <p>
             I worked as a software engineer in the professional services team and was an individual contributor till March 2019. I was the lead for 7 applications developed for the professional services team and clients. Received an award for 'Most Valuable Techie' Quarter 1 of 2020.
             <br>My additional responsibilities included training new engineers, and working with different teams to make sure the legacy applications are up to date with the company's technology standards.

          <p>
             In my last semester of undergrad, I joined Avalara as an Engineering intern on the skyscraper team. As an intern, I was given a new project to work on which was related to GST and my task was to automate the filing. It was a standalone feature and I worked on it from scratch and received an award for the same.<br>As an intern, I also got a chance to work along with the QA team and automate test cases for them. I was offered a full-time and decided to pursue my career as an engineer/developer.

            I joined VIT for my computer science program as an undergraduate. I had direct entry into the second year because I decided to pursue a technical diploma in computer science after my sophomore year(10th grade). During my bachelor's I did several projects to see where my interests lie and also published a paper on breast cancer prediction. You can see more about my projects in the project section.

          <p>
          I always wanted to be an engineer, a developer even though I didn't really know what we did. My country offers students to get a technical diploma in computer science after sophomore year and I was extremely sure about my goals, I joined AISSMS polytechnic and was the highest in my batch with a score of 91% and received an award for the same.
